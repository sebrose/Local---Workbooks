# Release notes - BDD Fundamentals v 4.0

* Reworded some of the starter questions to be less ambiguous
* Moved 'BDD From 5000 feet' to the end of the day
* Reworded the instructions in 'Concrete Examples' to get them writing examples early
* Reworded imperative/declarative scenarios in 'Gherkin SPecifications' to address inconsistencies
* Rename 'Unit test' to 'Programmer test' in process flow diagram
** Ryan also suggests 'customer' instead of 'acceptance' test
* Replace/remove 'Requirements' from 'Rules-Examples-Tests' with 'Rules' throughout.
** Remove the list of labels for the diagram and let them choose their own - we can introduce the *correct* words in the discussion
** Reflect on Rules vs. examples before reviewing the rule/example exercise
* Reword 'Example mapping' instructions to make the exercise less dependent on the user story
* Remove suggested story from Shouty product concept
** Reword functional requirements to be clearer

## Suggestions
* Cover tags explicitly in Gherkin section - useful for managers etc.
