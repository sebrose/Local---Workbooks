    \QandAbox{Is this enough documentation about how the system works? What other documentation might be useful?}{3}

    A \emph{workflow scenario} is intended to describe a single user journey through the system. 
    
    Recall the checklist we discussed earlier. On the list below, cross out those that should not apply to workflow scenarios:
     
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Concrete
        \item Essential
        \item Declarative
        \item Focused
        \item Ubiquitous
        \item Interesting
    \end{itemize}
