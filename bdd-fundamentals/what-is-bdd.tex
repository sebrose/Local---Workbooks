\chapter*{What is BDD?}

\ifnotes

    Learning outcomes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explain how discovery and exploration are connected and collaborative 
        \item Describe how automated tests drive out implementation
        \item Show that collaborative Discovery is the pre-requisite, mandatory practice for BDD, while business-readable Gherkin and automated living documentation are valuable, downstream outputs
    \end{itemize}
    
    BDD is hard to define. Matt's quote is succinct. You may also describe BDD as a stack of 3 practices: Discovery, Formulation and Automation.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Discovery - discovery/exploration with conversation and concrete examples
        \item Formulation - defining behaviour in business language
        \item Automation - driving out the implementation with automated tests
    \end{itemize}

    In the preceding quote, what does Matt mean by the following terms?
    
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Explore

        \item Discover
            
            \fbox{\begin{minipage}{6.0in}\hfill\vspace{0.3in}\end{minipage}}
    
        \item Define
            
            \fbox{\begin{minipage}{6.0in}\hfill\vspace{0.3in}\end{minipage}}
    
        \item Drive out
            
            \fbox{\begin{minipage}{6.0in}\hfill\vspace{0.3in}\end{minipage}}
    
        \item Conversation
            
            \fbox{\begin{minipage}{6.0in}\hfill\vspace{0.3in}\end{minipage}}
    
        \item Concrete examples
            
            \fbox{\begin{minipage}{6.0in}\hfill\vspace{0.3in}\end{minipage}}
    
        \item Automated tests

    \end{enumerate}

    Which of the above are missing in the way you work today?
