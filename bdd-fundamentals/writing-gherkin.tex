\section*{Write your own Gherkin}

\ifnotes

    There's often not enough time to do this exercise, but it is valuable.

\ifcontent

    Can you see how you can translate the examples that you created during the Example Mapping exercise into Gherkin? 
    
    Pick a few and, using what we've learnt, turn them into Gherkin. You can use a laptop at this point if you wish, or just a paper and pen.
