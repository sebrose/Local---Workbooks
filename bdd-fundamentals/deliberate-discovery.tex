\chapter*{Deliberate discovery}

\ifnotes
    Learning outcomes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explain how communication is a major source of defects
        \item Give examples of how requirements are never well understood at the beginning of a project
        \item Describe how these problems have existed forever and that 'agile' on its own cannot solve it
    \end{itemize}
    
    When reviewing the Deliberate Discovery concept, I usually tie this BDD back to money. I ask "why are you paying for BDD training?" and keeping asking "why?" until we get to cost savings. 
    
    I'll often draw a cost vs time exponential graph and tell the 10x story "it's ten time cheaper to fix a defect during development than in test... etc."
    
    I'll stress that "doing testing earlier" encompasses the Liz Keogh quotes about "learning being the constraint", so focus on learning early.
