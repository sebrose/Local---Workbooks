       "Being Product Owner is hard. Actually, that's not quite true. Anybody can make a list of things to build, call it a backlog, and bring it to a few meetings every month. Being a \emph{great} Product Owner is hard. Development skills are essential, but it doesn't matter how fast your team delivers and how good your quality is unless you're delivering the right thing every day. Identifying and expressing that \emph{right thing} at every level of detail is a big job."
