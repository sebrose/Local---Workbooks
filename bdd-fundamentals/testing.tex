\chapter*{Testing}

\ifnotes
    Learning outcomes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describe how requirements can be tested using examples
        \item Explain why not all testing can be automated
        \item Understand that testing is a broader activity than typically understood
    \end{itemize}
        
    Delegates often don't find much to discuss on this poster. Direct them to the Jerry Weinberg quote and ask them to consider his definition of testing when discussing the questions.
    
    You may need to directly engage them in conversation for the last minute or two of their time at this concept centre, to help them realise that testing is broader than typically understood.
    
    When reviewing this slide, it's useful to refer to Elisabeth Hendrickson's idea that testing is a combination of Checking (that can be automated) and Exploring (which can't be automated)
