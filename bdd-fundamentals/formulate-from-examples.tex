\chapter*{Formulating our examples}

The examples that we collect during our collaboration sessions are precise illustrations of how a rule should behave, but they're often not very readable. The team will take the examples that are interesting to the business and formulate them as business readable documentation using the a format called \emph{Gherkin}.

We'll learn more about Gherkin shortly, but for now let's see how we could formulate the library example that we looked at earlier:

\hspace*{1cm} \emph{Context}: Person has an adult library membership \\
\hspace*{1cm} \emph{Action}: Reserves 1 book \\
\hspace*{1cm} \emph{Outcome}: Should be charged \$1

This could be formulated as:

\hspace*{1cm} \emph{Given} Andrew has an adult membership \\
\hspace*{1cm} \emph{When} he reserves a book \\
\hspace*{1cm} \emph{Then} he should be charged \$1

Each line of your formulated example must start with one of the following five keywords:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Given
    \item When
    \item Then
    \item And
    \item But
\end{itemize}
