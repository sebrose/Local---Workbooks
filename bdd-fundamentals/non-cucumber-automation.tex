\chapter*{Automation}

We would like all automated tests to exhibit these characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Understandable} - the test should be easy to read and understand
    \item \emph{Maintainable} - the test suite should be easy to modify when the requirements change
    \item \emph{Repeatable} - the test should either always pass or always fail
    \item \emph{Necessary} - every test should test something that needs tested and isn't tested elsewhere
    \item \emph{Granular} - each test should validate a single piece of behaviour
    \item \emph{Fast} - tests should run fast
\end{itemize}

At your tables, discuss the each of the questions below. Take notes and/or draw diagrams because you'll be sharing your insights with the other tables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can you think of any problems you might have ensuring automated tests are reliable?
    \item How long would a 'typical' test take to run in your environment(s), and what challenges might that cause?
    \item Why would you want tests to be easy to read and understand?
    \item Are there scarce resources that you need to acquire/reserve before you can do your testing?
    \item What automation tools do you have available?
\end{itemize}
