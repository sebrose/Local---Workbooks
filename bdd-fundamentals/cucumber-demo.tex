    Learning Outcomes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describe one way that Cucumber can be run
        \item Explain at least one of Cucumber's built in output formats
    \end{itemize}

    Run Cucumber on the starting point of Shouty on the projector. There is one failing and one passing scenario. This is a good basis for illustration and discussion.
