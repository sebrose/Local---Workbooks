    Identify the good and bad parts of each scenario
    
    The following orientation questions can help you with the review
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is each scenario focused on illustrating a single business rule?
        \item Are there too many / too few details?
        \item Does it use a language that everyone understands?
        \item How likely is it that this scenario will change when unrelated parts of the application changes?
    \end{itemize}

        And I have a card with the PIN 5173
        And I push my card into the machine
        And I enter 5173 for my PIN
        And I push the button next to "Withdrawal"
        And I push the button next to "Checking"
        When I push the button next to "$50"
        Then I should receive two $20 and one $10
