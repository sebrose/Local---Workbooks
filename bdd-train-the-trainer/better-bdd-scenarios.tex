    \section*{Review some scenarios}
    Work in pairs or 3 people mini-groups
    
    Identify the good and bad parts of each scenario
    
    The following orientation questions can help you with the review
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is it clear what each scenario is describing?
        \item Are there too many / too few details?
        \item Does it use a language that everyone understands?
        \item How likely is it that this scenario will change when the application changes?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{framed}
        Scenario: Username should be unique
        
        \begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{}
            Given a user "Marvin" is in the database \\
            And I navigate to http://myapp.com \\
            And I click on "Register" \\
            And I fill in "Username" with "Marvin" \\
            And I fill in "Password" with "1234" \\
            When I click on "Submit registration" \\
            Then "ValidationSummary" should be visible \\
            And "ValidationSummary" should contain "Username already in use"
        \end{adjustwidth}

    \begin{framed}
        Scenario: Delivery address change
        
        \begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{}
            Given I have placed an order \\
            When I change the delivery address \\
            Then I should receive a confirmation \\
            And the estimated arrival time should be updated \\
            And the delivery person should be notified about the new address
        \end{adjustwidth}

    \begin{framed}

            Given I visit Geek Pizza shop site \\
            And I browse for "Margarita" pizza \\
            And I add the pizza to the basket \\
            And I proceed to checkout \\
            And I enter delivery address \\ 
            And I enter payment details \\
            When I confirm the order \\
