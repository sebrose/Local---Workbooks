    \begin{itemize}
        \item Complex regular expressions
        \item Many similar regular expressions
        \item Stepdefs are more than a couple of lines long
        \item Automation code does not accurately implement promises of the Gherkin
        \item All stepdefs are End-To-End
        \item Gherkin is translated into another format for automation
        \item Environments that don't have a Cucumber implementation assume implementation is not possible
        \item Support code is not shared between stepdefs and programmer tests
        \item Reliance on the existence of unchanging test data
        \item Stepdef code is not subject to coding standards
        \item Scenarios are not adequately isolated from each other
        \item Transforms not used where appropriate
        \item Hooks not used where appropriate
        \item Stepdef files not partitioned by domain concept
        \item Assertion stepdefs are overly strict
        \item Scenarios not being automated before the corresponding development starts
        \item Developers not working in a TDD approach
    \end{itemize}
