\chapter*{Appendix - Running Cucumber}

Cucumber can be executed in different ways. Here are two alternatives available for this course.

\section*{Maven}

Cucumber is executed as a JUnit test with s special JUnit runner. This means that running Cucumber using Maven is the same as running the tests with Maven.
Try each of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{mvn test}
    \item \texttt{mvn test -Dcucumber.options="-{}-strict"}
    \item \texttt{mvn test -Dtest="CoordinateTest"}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Command line}

Running Cucumber from a command line can be done like this (although you will need your classpath setup correctly)

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{java cucumber.api.cli.Main}
\end{itemize}


\section*{Documentation}
The documentation for running Cucumber is available at: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm}
\end{itemize}
