\section*{Write your own Gherkin}

\begin{framed}
At my local library, it's free to take out books that are on the shelves, but there is a charge if you want to reserve an item that is currently on loan. The charges are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adults - \pounds 1.00 per item
    \item Children - Free for up to 6 children's books on a child's membership card, but 50p per item for all others
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}


Think of some examples of library users trying to reserve books. DON'T use Gherkin yet. 

Here's an example:

\hspace{2cm} "The Hobbit" is on loan and Fred is charged \pounds 1.00 to reserve it

Once you have at least three further examples, start translating them into Gherkin.
